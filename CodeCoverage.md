Generate a code coverage report in HTML for a Java project using Gradle and JaCoCo.

**Step 1: Project Structure**

Lets assume you have a directory structure like this:

```
my-java-project/
├── build.gradle
└── src/
    └── main/
    └── test/
```

**Step 2: Add Dependencies**

Edit your `build.gradle` file to include the JaCoCo plugin and configure it. Here's a sample `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'jacoco'
}

repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    // Add your project dependencies here
}

test {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}

jacocoTestReport {
    reports {
        xml.enabled true
        html.enabled true
    }
}
```

**Step 3: Write Tests**

Write your Java unit tests in the `src/test/` directory.

**Step 4: Generate Code Coverage Report**

Run the following command in the terminal within your project directory to execute tests and generate code coverage reports:

```
./gradlew clean test jacocoTestReport
```

This command will clean the project, run tests, and generate JaCoCo code coverage reports.

**Step 5: Access the HTML Report**

After running the command, you can find the HTML code coverage report in the following directory:

```
build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html
```

Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the code coverage report. It will display detailed information about which parts of your code were covered by your tests and which were not.

Commit the the entire code coverage folder in your repo.
